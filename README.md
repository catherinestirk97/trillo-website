# trillo-website
This website was made by following an advanced CSS and SASS course on Udemy. This was a flexbox based project, and I used the concepts learned from this project to alter the original code for the natours project, which was originally written using floats and an old manual grid system. Below is an overview of the flexbox concepts I learned:

- Using flex-direction and order in addition to media queries in order to change the order/layout of the page dependent on the screen size
- Using justify-content and align-items as an easy way to center items 
- Using nested flex-containers to get the desired design 
- Effectively using SVG icons for design
